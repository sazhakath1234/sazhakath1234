Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a Data Analyst with a solid foundation in using data to extract meaningful insights and solve complex problems. I have extensive experience with SQL, Python, Tableau, Excel, and VBA, and I specialize in data manipulation, cleaning, visualization, and building interactive dashboards.

On this GitHub, youâ€™ll find a collection of my projects that showcase my skills in data analysis, data wrangling, statistical modeling, and data visualization. I focus on delivering clear, actionable insights through clean, efficient code and well-structured analyses.

Feel free to explore my work, contribute, or reach out if youâ€™re interested in collaborating or sharing feedback. Iâ€™m always excited to connect with fellow data professionals and learn new techniques.
